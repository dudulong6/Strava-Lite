## Project description
Strava Lite is a basic server application that helps users track their running workouts. Users can sign up, view profiles, add workouts, and follow other users.

## Problem and solution
There was a problem with JSON data processing during the development process, but it was successfully solved by referring to Flask documentation and community resources.
There is minimal error handling, which might make it hard to identify issues during runtime.
Solution: Enhance error handling by adding descriptive error messages, logging errors, and catching exceptions using try-except blocks. Use Pythonâ€™s logging module to record error details, which helps in debugging and operational monitoring.
