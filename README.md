## Project description
Strava Lite is a basic server application that helps users track their running workouts. Users can sign up, view profiles, add workouts, and follow other users.

## Problem and solution
There was a problem with JSON data processing during the development process, but it was successfully solved by referring to Flask documentation and community resources.
